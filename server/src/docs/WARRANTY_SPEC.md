## Warranty Module (Condensed Spec)

This file is an abridged version of the full specification provided. It defines:

- Warranty issuance, activation, transfer, revoke
- WarrantyClaim workflow basics (create + status update)
- Data models & indexes (see models folder)
- Service layer stubs in `services/`
- Routes exposed under `/api/warranty` and `/api/warranty-claims`

Further tasks (PDF generation, notifications, fraud flags enrichment, SLA tracking, analytics caching, permissions) remain TODO.
