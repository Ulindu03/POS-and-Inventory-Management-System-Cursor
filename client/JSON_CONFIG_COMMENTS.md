# JSON Config File Explanations (Simple English)

This file explains the purpose of each JSON config file in the `client` folder, since JSON does not support comments inside the files themselves.

**package.json**
- Lists the project's dependencies and scripts for building, running, and managing the app.

**package-lock.json**
- Locks the exact versions of installed dependencies to make sure everyone uses the same versions.

- Sets up TypeScript settings for the whole project.

**tsconfig.app.json**
